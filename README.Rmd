## Overview

newsrivr is a R wrapper to the [Newsriver API](https://newsriver.io/), providing simple functions to retrieve and clean news articles following a tidy framework. It is free for non-commercial purposes, and when combined with newsrivr, can return over 350,000 articles in a single call.

## Installation

You can install the development version from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("MikeJohnPage/newsrivr")
```

## Usage

newsrivr follows a simple workflow: (1) store credentials, (2) retrieve news, (3) clean news.

### Storing credentials

To access the Newsriver API, you will need to (freely) register an [API token](https://console.newsriver.io/api-token). In addition to an API token, you are also required to provide a user agent to use the newsrivr package. This allows Newsriver to identify who is using the API (and is important if something goes wrong). A good default user agent is your email address. To make your credentials available to newsrivr at every session, use the `store_credentials()` function, which will prompt you for your API token and user agent and then append them to a `.Renviron` file located in your home directory:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(newsrivr)

# you will be prompted for your credentials
store_creds()
```

If you would not like newsrivr to alter your `.Renviron` file, you can use the `store_creds_temp()` which just makes the credentials available for the current R session only:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# you will be prompted for your credentials
store_creds_temp()
```

Alternatively, you can manually pass your API token and user credentials into the relevant newsrivr functions (below), however, this isn't recommended as credentials can accidentally get leaked in scripts and `.Rhistory`
files. See the `?store_credentials` documentation for more information.

### Retrieving news

The `get_news()` function returns news articles from the Newsriver API matching a user provided search query. This query allows users to search across the title and text fields of news articles. See the `?get_news` documentation for more information:

```{r, include = FALSE}
library(newsrivr)
```


```{r, warning = FALSE}
get_news(query = "Google")

get_news("Google", from = "2019-05-01", to = "2019-06-01")

get_news("title:Google AND text:\"Google Cloud\"", language = "it")
```

### Cleaning news

The `clean_news()` function wrangles the messy data fetched by get_news, returning a tidy tibble with sensible defaults.

```{r, warning = FALSE}
news <- get_news(query = "Google")

clean_news(news)
```
